Twitter Sentiment Analysis Web App
Python, Scikit-learn, NLP, Gradio, Pandas

Developed a machine learningâ€“based web application that analyzes the sentiment of tweets (positive, negative, or neutral). Preprocessed tweet text using NLP techniques (tokenization, stopword removal, regex cleaning), and trained a Naive Bayes classifier on labeled data. Deployed the model using Gradio to allow users to input tweets and receive real-time sentiment predictions via a user-friendly web interface.

Key Contributions:

Implemented text preprocessing pipeline using NLTK and regular expressions.

Built and trained a sentiment classifier using CountVectorizer + MultinomialNB.

Integrated the model into a Gradio-based front end for interactive user input.

Achieved high classification accuracy and robust generalization on unseen tweets.
